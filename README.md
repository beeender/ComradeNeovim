Brings JetBrains/IntelliJ IDEs magic to Neovim.

ComradeNeovim creates a bridge between JetBrains IDEs and Neovim to bi-directly
synchronize editing contents between them and bring features like auto
completion, linting and quick fix to Neovim.

**You also need to install the neovim side plugin to make this work. Please refer to [Comrade](https://github.com/beeender/Comrade).**
